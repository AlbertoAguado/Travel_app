# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
In this project I have created an app that connects with the openweathermapÂ´s API and return the weather in the place selected by the zip that is introduced by the input.

## app.js
Here I have created the function that is executed when the generate button is pressed we get the data from the openweater API and the UI is updated with the data from the APi and with the data that is introduced by the user. 

## server.js
Here I have included express, cors and bodyparser, selected the port where the app will be executing and the post and get routes
